# tricky-solutions
One man's trip into the world of self-hosting and home-labbing. This repo is for projects I build for fun.

/*

About Me:

I'm a Canadian home-labber and I made this repo to post solutions from my hobbies.

Interested in these types of projects at the moment:

  1) Self-hosting services
  
  2) Docker && Portainer
  
  3) Raspberry pi stuff
  
  4) Web Design
  
Check out my files and help improve my solutions, or borrow my code if it helps you.
