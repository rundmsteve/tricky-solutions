# tricky-solutions
One man's trip into the world of Computer Science. This repo is for projects I build for fun and assigned apps.

/*

About Me:

I'm a Canadian Computer Science Student and I made this repo to post solutions from my coursework and my hobbies.

Interested in these types of solutions at the moment:

  1) Visual C# Applications
  
  2) Windows IoT Core Applications
  
  3) Python Apps for RPi3
  
  4) Automotive Monitor & Control Modules
  
Check out my files and help improve my solutions, or borrow my code if it helps you.
