# tricky-solutions
One man's trip into the world of Computer Science. This repo is for alpha-builds and for contributors to dump code.

/*

About Me:

I'm a Canadian Computer Science Student and I made this repo to post solutions from my coursework and my hobbies.

Interested in these types of solutions at the moment:

  1) Visual C# Applications
  2) Windows IoT Core Applications
  3) Python Apps for RPi3
  4) Automotive Monitor & Control Modules
  
Check out my files and help improve my solutions, or borrow my code if it helps you.

Please note that I will eventually make certain solutions commercially available for sale. I will follow the MIT guidelines for citing contributions. Contributors will not be involved in any of my commercial ventures. The main purpose of this repo is to provide a place to dump code for project members. We welcome anonymous contribution from the community and hope that our contributions can help others in their own ventures.  

Final builds by tricky-solutions will not be distributed through GIT. I can be contacted by email at rundmsteveo@gmail.com
